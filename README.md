Pinger 4 is simpler, cheaper and smaller than previous versions. It uses an external crystal to help generate an accurate 1 second pulse and a high brightness LED to give an external flash via a piece of fibre optic. Battery life 3 days + . The Banggood ultrasonic transducer projects a narrow "torchbeam" which makes locating a lost model submarine much easier. You can follow the bearing. This worked very well this August 2023 when we located my lost Holland sub by wading out on the bearing.
